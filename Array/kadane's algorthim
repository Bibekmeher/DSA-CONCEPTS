Here’s a **slightly detailed but still revision-friendly** version 👍

## Kadane’s Algorithm (Revision Notes)

**Problem:**  
Find the **maximum sum of a contiguous subarray**.

**Core Idea:**  
Maintain a running sum of the subarray.  
If the sum becomes negative, discard it and start fresh.

**Why it works:**  
A negative sum will only reduce the sum of any future subarray.

**Pseudocode:**
```

currentSum = 0
maxSum = -∞

for each element x in array:
currentSum = currentSum + x
maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum)

```
if currentSum < 0:
    currentSum = 0
```

return maxSum

```

**Key Points:**
- Handles positive and negative numbers
- Works even when all elements are negative
- Linear scan of the array

**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

**Example:**  
`[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1] → 6`
```

If you want, I can also give a **1-line intuition for interviews** or a **dry run table**.
